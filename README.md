# HorrorIceCreamShop
This is a project for my Algorithms and Data Structure Class.

With the end of winter and the arrival of spring days, your cousin has just opened an ice cream parlor.
who promises to be the hit of his age, only he's always been the weirdo in the family and the ice cream parlor has
Some rules that concern the parentage:
The ice cream parlor has cups for 2 scoops of ice cream;
Your cousin never puts a strong flavor (e.g. mega-ultra-power-100%) chocolate on top of
a mild flavor (e.g. yoghurt), because then nobody tastes the mild flavor when they get to it;
Your cousin has a who-is-stronger-than-who list to guide you through serving
the cups (according to his opinion, but that's another story);
It never accepts repeat flavor orders, so people can try more
flavors;
Now her family is a little concerned that these conditions could greatly limit her
number of orders that can be fulfilled. They ask you (the family computer expert, since you install Windows for everyone) to take the who-is-stronger-than-who list and say how many different cups of ice cream are possible in the ice cream parlor.
